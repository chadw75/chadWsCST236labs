#. What was the hardest part of this lab?

The hardest part of this lab was getting everything working.

#. During the course of this lab, why did we exclude .pyc files?

I will say the pyc files were excluded because of the possible damage they could do to a repo if you don’t quite understand what you are adding.

#. Name three files which would likely need to have a gitignore added?

I’m assuming here but .cpp files .cs, .java .css and or any files that execute code?

#. What is a pyunit TestCase?



#. What is the difference between a git cherry pick and a rebase?



#. How could you use git to print out just the author name of a given file for the current version of the repo?



#. During this lab did you explore Tortoise Git or GIT Extensions? If not take a look at them, they probably would be useful for the remainder of the class



#. Did you find the second issue in get_triangle_type? Did you choose to test the code as is or fix the code in get_triangle_type
